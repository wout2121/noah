/**
 * Recurring (scheduled) payments.
 *
 * A recurring payment is a spending policy the user approves once: a fixed
 * amount, a fixed recipient and a fixed interval. The policy lives only on the
 * device and is executed by the wallet itself. The Noah server only receives an
 * opaque schedule id and the next due time so it can wake the device with a
 * silent push; it never learns the amount or recipient and cannot move funds.
